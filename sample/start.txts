|=Example games are not complete=|

This is only an example.  Therefore, there is not a game here, but just some
stuff to help you make a game of your own.  This is nothing against you
personally; everyone with this program has the same useless "game".  Unless
of course someone deleted it, which could happen quite a lot, because it's a
pointless game.
